<p>OttoPlot is a creative, generative art project conceived to push the boundaries of my software development skills. Employing a pen plotting machine, Python, and Houdini (Python + VEX), the system processes 3D models into 2D representations and translates them into GCode - the language that CNC machines utilize. This GCode is subsequently transferred to the pen plotter, which diligently sketches the designs onto paper.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>OttoPlot emerged from the desire to go beyond the typical web-app development work I was doing from 9-5 and explore generative art. This was an opportunity to revisit fundamental math and challenge myself to learn a new language (VEX).</p>

<h3 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h3>

<p>To create generative art through creative programming, thereby transforming 3D models into unique 2D representations.</p>

<h2 id="technology-stack">Technology Stack</h2>

<p>To ensure the flawless execution of this intricate process, a robust and specialized tech stack was utilized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Houdini</li>
  <li>Python (with VEX in Houdini)</li>
  <li>Pen Plotting Machine</li>
  <li>GCode</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-journey">Project Journey</h2>

<p>OttoPlotâ€™s journey began with curiousity and exploration, during which I revisited basic geometry, algorithm design, and learned about GCode generation. This learning phase was instrumental in shaping the trajectory of the project and in setting a solid foundation for the development work ahead.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing Python scripts to process 3D models into 2D representations.</li>
  <li>Learning and implementing VEX scripting in Houdini for advanced 3D model manipulation.</li>
  <li>Parsing 2D representations into GCode.</li>
  <li>Managing and calibrating the pen plotting machine to ensure accurate output.</li>
  <li>Refining the algorithm to optimize the aesthetic appeal of the final designs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

<p><strong>Mathematical Modeling</strong>: Developed and implemented complex geometrical and algorithmic models.
<strong>Software Development</strong>: Designed and wrote Python scripts for model processing and GCode generation.
<strong>Machine Operation</strong>: Managed the pen plotting machine, ensuring its calibration and correct operation.
<strong>Aesthetic Refinement</strong>: Iteratively improved the algorithm to optimize the aesthetic appeal of the final designs.</p>
