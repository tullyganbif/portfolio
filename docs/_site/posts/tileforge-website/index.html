        <div class="content"><p>After the public launch of the TileForge builder, we needed a website that could capture leads and nurture prospective customers into converted users. We knew we were going to rely heavily on content marketing, so integrating email sign ups and a blog was important. The website would not only function as an informational hub about the product but also hosts an engaging blog and facilitates user registration.</p>

<p>You can view the active website at: <a href="https://tileforge.com">www.tileforge.com</a></p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Our aim was ambitious yet straightforward: to develop an engaging, informative platform that would not only act as a gateway to our map builder but also significantly enhance our content marketing efforts. A crucial part of our strategy was the inclusion of a blog and email sign-ups, which would help in both attracting and nurturing leads. Building on this foundation, we devised TileForge Website, which has since played a pivotal role in converting prospects into active users, with a customer base that continues to grow steadily.</p>

<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>

<p>To create an attractive, high converting website for the TileForge project.</p>

<h2 id="technology-stack">Technology Stack</h2>

<p>To ensure a superior user experience and peak performance, we employed a robust tech stack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contentful</li>
  <li>NextJS</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>React Redux</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>Vercel</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-development">Project Development</h2>

<p>Following the public launch of the TileForge builder, our team dedicated itself to developing a complementary website that would aid in lead generation and user conversion. The project started in May 2023, shortly after the builderâ€™s launch, and culminated in a successful public release in September 2023. My role during this period was extensive and included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establishing the Contentful database to manage website content efficiently.</li>
  <li>Integrating an engaging blog section to bolster content marketing efforts.</li>
  <li>Incorporating an email sign-up feature to capture and nurture leads.</li>
  <li>Streamlining UI/UX for a smooth and user-friendly browsing experience.</li>
</ul>
